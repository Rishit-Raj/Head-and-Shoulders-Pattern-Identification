# Project 1: Algorithmic Trading Technical Pattern Identification using Python - Head and Shoulders

## What is the Head and Shoulders Pattern?

The Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern is a visual chart formation used in technical analysis. It is composed of three main peaks (or troughs for an inverted pattern) and a neckline:

Left Shoulder (LS) ‚Äì The first rise (or dip in inverted) in the price, followed by a small pullback.

Head (H) ‚Äì The highest peak (or lowest trough in inverted), forming the center of the pattern.

Right Shoulder (RS) ‚Äì A second rise or dip that is lower than the head but similar in height to the left shoulder.

Neckline ‚Äì A line connecting the lowest points between the shoulders (in a top pattern) or the highest points (in an inverted pattern).

Break Point ‚Äì The level at which the price breaks through the neckline, confirming the pattern.

Start and End Points ‚Äì Define where the pattern begins to form and where it is confirmed by a breakout.

This pattern visually resembles a human head with two shoulders, which is where it gets its name.

## Historical Performance and Ideal Usage

Success Rate: ~65‚Äì75% on daily charts of S&P 500 stocks

When It Works Best:

    1. Appears after an extended uptrend or downtrend

    2. Breakout occurs with high trading volume

    3. Pattern is clear and symmetrical

Timeframes: More reliable on daily and weekly charts than on short intraday charts

Market Type: Works best in liquid markets like the S&P 500 or large-cap stocks

Confirmation: Often combined with indicators like RSI, MACD, or Volume to increase reliability

## Understanding the project

This project provides a Python implementation to **detect and analyze
Head and Shoulders (H&S) patterns**---a classic technical analysis
formation used in trading and investing. It supports **standard** patterns.

## Features

-   **Automatic detection** of:
    -   Left Shoulder
    -   Head
    -   Right Shoulder
    -   Neckline and breakout points
-   **Pattern metrics calculation**, including:
    -   Neckline slope
    -   Head width & height
-   **Visualization** using `mplfinance` for candlestick charts
-   **Integration with Yahoo Finance** for real market data
-   **Support for inverted (bullish) H&S patterns**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Structure

    head-and-shoulders.py   # Main script for pattern detection and visualization
    rolling_window.py       # Utility for rolling top/bottom detection (imported)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Python Modules Used

This project uses a combination of Python modules for data processing, technical analysis, and visualization:

**pandas** ‚Äì Efficiently handles stock price data as DataFrames.

**numpy** ‚Äì Used for numerical computations like slopes and distances.

**matplotlib** ‚Äì Creates general line and pattern plots.

**mplfinance** ‚Äì Generates professional candlestick and OHLC charts.

**yfinance** ‚Äì Fetches historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required Python libraries:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib mplfinance yfinance
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage

1.  **Import and Run the Script**

``` python
import head_and_shoulders as hs

# Example: Fetch and analyze Apple (AAPL) stock
import yfinance as yf

data = yf.download("AAPL", period="1y", interval="1d")
patterns = hs.detect_head_and_shoulders(data['Close'])
```

2.  **Visualize Detected Patterns**

``` python
hs.plot_patterns(data, patterns)
```

This will display candlestick charts with detected **Head and
Shoulders** formations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example Output

-   **Annotated candlestick charts** highlighting the left shoulder,
    head, right shoulder, and neckline.
-   **Pattern statistics** including head height, neckline slope, and
    breakout point.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How It Works

1.  **Rolling Window Detection**
    -   Uses `rw_top` and `rw_bottom` from `rolling_window.py` to find
        local peaks and troughs.
2.  **Pattern Recognition**
    -   Identifies sequences of left shoulder ‚Üí head ‚Üí right shoulder
        with a neckline.
3.  **Visualization**
    -   Plots candlestick charts with overlayed patterns using
        `mplfinance`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Applications

-   Technical analysis for **trading strategies**
-   Identifying potential **trend reversals**
-   Backtesting **pattern-based trading algorithms**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

-   This project is for **educational purposes** and does **not
    constitute financial advice**.
-   Accuracy depends on **data quality** and **parameter tuning**.
-   Works for **daily and intraday** intervals.
